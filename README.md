# CodeWars My Top 10 Solutions

Instead of putting all my solutions to this repository, I wanted to pick, arguably, my top 10 solutions to the problems that I want to share with you. I also included the Katas that I created and translated from one language to another. If you want to see all my statistics in CodeWars please look at my profile:

1. **[Evaluate Mathematical Expression](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52a78825cdfc2cfc87000005)**

    **Summary**: In this Kata you are expected to evaluate every form of mathematical expression. It can consist of parantheses operations negative numbers(e.g '6 + -( -4)').  

1. **[Simpler Interactive Interpreter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53005a7b26d12be55c000243)**

    **Summary**: In this Kata you are expected to implement simple interpreter. It has variable assignment, mathematical expression evaluation, variable outputs and more. Check the link for more detailed explanation.

1. **[Rail Fence Cipher](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58c5577d61aefcf3ff000081)**

    **Summary**: In this Kata you are expected to encode the given text according to Rail Fence Cipher, and find a way to decipher back (Implement encode and decode function). 

1. **[Path Finder #3: the Alpinist](https://www.codewars.com/kata/576986639772456f6f00030c)**

    **Summary**: Hidden Dijkstra's algorithm.

1. **[Block Sequence](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5e1ab1b9fe268c0033680e5f)**

    **Summary**: 

1. Factorial tail

1. Vigen√®re Cipher Helper

1. Pyramid Slide Down

1. Next smaller number with the same digits

1. Huffman Encoding









These are all the Katas that I created, translated and solved in CodeWars which is a problem-solving website. 

For the difficulty of the katas you can refer to this place (I'll not put here the Katas that I solved in yellow and white ones; however, I think the ones that I create and translate from one language to another worth mentioning):
