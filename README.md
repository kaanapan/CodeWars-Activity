**Disclaimer:**  This repository is not for CodeWarriors. If you are stuck while solving a problem and looking for a hint/solution, please ask a question about it. Please do not just jump into solution and copy-past a solution. 

**Overview** : I wanted to pick, arguably, my top 10 solutions to the problems that I want to share with you instead of putting all my solutions into this repository. I added the Katas that I created and translated from one language to another. If you want to see all my statistics in CodeWars please look at my profile:
